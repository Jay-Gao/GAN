# GAN
mainly implement dcgan model with [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [tensorlayer](http://tensorlayer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
(a high-level library for deep learning and reforcement learning based on tensorflow)   
For now, this is just a simple try on handwritten digit generating.
In the future, I will try more complex examples.
## Dependencies
python 3.5   
tensorflow 0.12   
tensorlayer 1.2.8   
numpy 1.11

## Run the code
run the code with: python dcgan.py
